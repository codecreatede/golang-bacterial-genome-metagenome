A golang microbiome and metagenomics data analyzer. It analyzes the microbial genomes either through the
typed annotations or generates the annotation as required by the NCBI microbial consortium submissions.
Typed annotation means desining the microbial tags for the sequencing. It takes the genome and allows
you to generate and extract the tags for the microbial genomes.
