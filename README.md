# golang-metagenome-analyzer

A golang microbiome and metagenomics data analyzer. It takes the genome and allows you to generate and extract the tags for the microbial genomes.
- You can extract operon,
- You can extract defined uORFs,
- You can extract and tokensize the generate tags for the machine learning.
- You can make a neural model for the deep learning.
- You can pass all the metagenomics annotations and generate the genomes and sub-genomes files.
